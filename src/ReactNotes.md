## JSX Rules

1. You must close self closing elements like <br/>
2. Components can only return a single element 

### Components 
    Building blocs of React just like Angular 
### Props
    Data passed to a component 
### State 
    Data specific to an instance of a component. IT CHANGES


## JSX syntax:

Using <> at the root of a component prevents having an extra <div></div> mucking up the DOM

{} tell JSX to treat the code as javascript


## Best Practices 

Don't shy away from making breaking things down into smaller components. This is important for reusability. 

## State
 > Use updator functions when you have a reactive piece of code that needs to show
